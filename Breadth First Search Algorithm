Breadth First Search Algorithm

*BFS:

Can be grid or tree view (or graph).

Pseudocode:
- en-queue the start waypoint
- while the queue has items
	- if we find the goal stop
	- de-queue frontier waypoint
	- for each direction from frontier
		- queue new unexplored waypoint
	- mark frontier as explored

NOTE: Checkout Diagram on Wikipedia on Breadth First Search using a,b,c,d,e,f,g and h.

Shortest path was a, b, e, h

---

*For our game direction will go clockwise starting from up-> right -> down -> left.

a|b|
g|c|e|
h|d|f|i|
l|m|k|z|

a,b,g,c,h,e,d,l,f,i,k,m,l,z

a->b->c->e->f->i->z
