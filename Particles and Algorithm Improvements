Particles and Algorithm Improvements

[To dos]
- Fix and Polish (avoiding bugs and start and end of path).
- Adding particle effects

NOTE: 
Ben had 'SetAsPath (previous);' and 'previous = previous.exploredFrom;' set opposite ->

previous = previous.exploredFrom;
SetAsPath (previous);

instead of 

SetAsPath (previous);
previous = previous.exploredFrom;

...this caused enemy prefab to be on startWaypoint 0,0 twice and endWaypoint jumped diagonally.

Be aware this is called 'Off By One Error'

Order of method does matter.

SetAsPath method must set previous path before previous can run previous is exploredfrom.

*Fixing Bullet bouncing off!

[Step 1 : ]

(What Ben did to stop Bouncing bullets)
Open Tower prefab -> Bullets (particle system) -> Collision -> adjust Min Kill Speed to 0

(What I did and why)
Open Tower prefab -> Bullets (particle system) -> Collision -> adjust Bounce to 0.

Adjusting min kill speed allow towers to shoot enemies faster when they are closer.

Particles still linger before disappearing. Still need to find a better solution for this.

[Step 2 : ]

Adding explosion on bullets destroying enemy.

Create a new '[SerializeField] ParticleSystem' name it 'explode'.
In 'KillEnemy' method instatiate a new variable 'vfx' and set vfx.Play() -> You can not just set it to '.PlayOnAwake'

Should look like this:

void KillEnemy ()
	{
		var vfx = Instantiate (explode, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
		vfx.Play ();
		Destroy (gameObject);
	}
