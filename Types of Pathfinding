**calculating the shortest path so that the game can run smoothly

Search Algorithms Overview

Search Algorithm:
- Breadth First Search BFS
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A Star

NOTE: movement cost in this case is the ability to move through different speeds.

BFS: 
- Always Shortest Path 
- Multiple End Points
- Medium (speed on 100X100 grid)
Notes: simple, versatile, fast enough most of the time (Point to Point pathfinding, but no speed changes allowed on path)

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
- Always Shortest Path
- Movement cost can vary
- Multiple end points
- Slow (speed on 100x100)
Notes: Movement cost allows for swamps, roads etc (Pathfinding can calculate if the swamp path is quicker or road path)

A Star:
- Choice (Developer can choose between speed vs accuracy)
- Movement cost can vary
- Fast (speed on 100x100)
Notes: Complex, Can trade speed against accuracy

** Explore out, leave bread crumbs and walk on path.

Search Algorithm Speed Comparison

(approximate worst-case number of calculations to find the shortest path)

Algorithm:
- BFS
- Dijkstra's
- A*

Speed:
BFS: V + E
Dijkstra: E+V log V
A* : varies

10x10grid:
BFS: 280
Dijsktra: 380
A*: 180

20x20 grid:
BFS: 1160
Dijkstra: 1801
A*: 760

100x100 grid
BFS: 29800 Medium
Dijkstra: 59800 Slow
A*: 19800 Fast

*S star has the benefit that we can chose the trade-off between speed and accuracy to suit our game.
