Circular Or Ring Buffers

www.how

Another mnemonic for question asking...

What? Are we talking about...
Why? Do we care...
Who? Already knows...
How? Do I do it...

[Why Ring Buffers Rock]

- Instantiating + Destroying can be slow operation
- Destroying leaves a 'hole' in memory
- Over time memory becomes fragmented
- Fragmented memory performs badly
- Basically it's recycling vs disposable
- You'll need to build your objects to last


Thought:

adjust min kill speed so that particle bullet stops bouncing/ lagging
set couroutine so that bullet can only fire after yielding to wait for x seconds

[To-do List]

- Create a Tower Factory class
- Move tower prefab and max towers there
- Note we'll tidy instantiated objects later
- Wire-up our tower factory, at least in outline
