Detecting Mouse in 3D

*Understanding how to place towers by knowning where the mouse is.

Task:
Placing Towers using OnMouseOver() -> provided my Unity

OnMouseOver():
- Called every frame when mouse is 'over' a collider
- Handy general purpose as it works in 2D too (works with GUI elements)
- Is simple than 'raycasting'

[Challenge]

Report Mouse Over Blocks:

- Lookup OnMouseOver() in Unity's docs
- See if you can log which block it's over

[Step 1 : ]

Open up Waypoint.cs

Remove:

	public void SetTopColor(Color color)
	{
		MeshRenderer topMeshRenderer = transform.Find ("Top").GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
		topMeshRenderer.material.color = color;
	}

...


Add void OnMouseOver()
{
	print(gameObject.name);
}

...Problem there is no box collider on this gameObject(coordinate).
If you look at the gameObject that Waypoint.cs is on there is no box collier.

Solution:

Add a box-collider on to coordinate. Set Box Collider -> Center Y value to -5 (since our world platform was originally moved down by -5 when first constructed our blocks)
Set Box Collider -> Size x:10 y: 10 z: 10
