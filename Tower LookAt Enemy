Tower LookAt Enemy

*Getting Towers to point look and 'shoot' at enemy

[Step 1 : ]
To Create a Tower!

-Create a Empty GameObject -> Rename Tower.
-Drag in Tower_Base to be a child of Tower
-Drag in Tower_Top to be a child of Tower.
-Reset Transform for Tower GameObject
-Adjust Tower_Base and Tower_Top transform:Scale to x:0.5, y:0.5, z:0.5
-Drag up Tower top by 5 to look like it is sitting on base

NOTE: Two parts because only the Tower_Top will be rotating and pivoting to follow Enemy

[Step 2 : ]

Create a new script on Tower -> call it Tower.cs

NOTE: We will be creating a method to get the tower to look at Enemies

- Remove 'void Start()' method

- Create a [SerializeField] variable -> with the Type Transform and the name objectToPan.

- Create a [SerializeField] variable -> Type Tranform with the name targetEnemy

Should look like this:

public class Tower : MonoBehaviour {

	[SerializeField] Transform objectToPan;
	[SerializeField] Transform targetEnemy;
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		
	}
}

[Step 3 : ]

Use 'transform.LookAt(target)' from unity manual as a reference to create a method for the tower to look at enemies.

Should look like this:

public class Tower : MonoBehaviour {

	[SerializeField] Transform objectToPan;
	[SerializeField] Transform targetEnemy;
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		objectToPan.LookAt(targetEnemy);
	}
}

[Step 4 : ]

-Move Tower into a position not on the path of the Enemy (Since there is no collision set yet). 

-Inspector while Tower is highlighted in the hierarchy drag and drop Tower_Top into Object to Pan slot under Tower(script)

-Do the same for the Enemy GameObject for the Target Enemy slot

-Test! Tower Should follow Enemy

-Drag Tower GameObject into Assets to make it a Prefab
