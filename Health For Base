Health For Base

[Step 1 : ]

Create a new script -> call it 'PlayerHealth.cs' on Friendly_Base.
Open the script -> Create a instance variable called 'health' of typ 'int; and set it to '10;'.
Create an instance variable for the amount of damage ->
Call it 'decreaseHealth' of type int set it's value to '1'.

[Step 2 : ]
Add a box collider on to 'Friendly_Base' and adjust it's position to the waypoint right infront of the 'Friendly_Base'. Make sure is Trigger is checked off

NOTE: An Enemy hitting the box collider will trigger a method.

Create a new method 'OnTriggerEnter()' that takes in the parameter 'Collider other'.

Set the 'health' to equal health - decreaseHealth;

jumps from 10 to 8??

Solution:

Enemy Prefab was left in the scene. During Play there were actually 2 Enemy prefabs moving at the same pace ontop of one another.

Remove Enemy -> in Enemies organize prefab. Hit play -> decrease will work properly
