Click and Instantiate Tower.

[Step 1 : ]

In Waypoint.cs create an '[SerializeField] Tower' name it 'TowerPrefab';

- SerializeField so that the prefab can be added via the Inspector
- Tower -> means that only GameObjects with Tower.cs attached to it can be added this avoids is issues like accidentally adding Enemy Prefab in the wrong spot

NOTE: similar to when trying to instantiate more than one enemyPrefab.

Should look like this:

public class Waypoint : MonoBehaviour {

	public bool isExplored = false;
	public Waypoint exploredFrom;
	public bool isPlaceable = true;
	[SerializeField] Tower TowerPrefab;

[Step 2 : ]

Holding Shift Select all of the coordinates (children of World prefab). Select the Tower GameObject and slide into the slot available in the Inspector -> Waypoint(script).

Hit Play and Start Clicking.

Problem! Towers can Stack on top of each other!

[Step 3 : ]

After clicking -> Instantiating a new tower make isPlaceable false;
This will stop Tower's from being allowed to be built on top of each other

void OnMouseOver()
	{
		if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) 
		{
			if (isPlaceable) 
			{
				print ("Placing at " + gameObject.name);
				Instantiate (TowerPrefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
				isPlaceable = false;
			}
			else
			{
				print ("Cannot place here");
			}
		}
