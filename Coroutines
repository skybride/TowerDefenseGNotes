Coroutines

*Change main camera view

Click on Main Camera -> GameObject -> Align with View (ctrl shift F)

Open Block Script and rename it Waypoint

Adjust Enemy Script -> rename all 'Block' Elements with Waypoint

Children GameObjects of World will now be broken. Click on the tiny circle below the setting cog where it says Nothing Selected and find Waypoint

NOTE: Think of Co-Routine and Main-Routine like Co-Pilot and Main-Pilot

yield = pause for a second

[Step 1 : Adding in a Coroutine]

Change 'private void PrintAllWaypoints()' -> 'IEnumerator PrintAllWaypoints()'. Add yield return new WaitForSeconds (1f);. Change 'PrintAllWaypoints()' in void Start -> 'StartCoroutine(PrintAllWaypoints());'

Should look like this:

public class EnemyMovement : MonoBehaviour {

	[SerializeField] List<Waypoint> path;

	void Start ()
	{
		StartCoroutine(PrintAllWaypoints());
	}

	IEnumerator PrintAllWaypoints()
	{
		foreach (Waypoint waypoint in path) 
		{
			print (waypoint.name);
			yield return new WaitForSeconds (1f);
		}
	}
}

[Step 2 : Set Enemy Transform to Waypoint's Transform]

'Remove print(waypoint.name);' -> Replace it with 'transform.position = waypoint.transform.position;'

Should look like this:

foreach (Waypoint waypoint in path) 
		{
			transform.position = waypoint.transform.position;
			yield return new WaitForSeconds (1f);
		}

[Step 3 : Rename PrintAllWaypoints]

Since we're now not trying to print the way points -> change the coroutine method to ' FollowPath'

NOTE:

Think of Coroutine like a yield instruction

[Step 3 : Get Enemy to Patrol and Log it's Position]

-Get the log printing the following...
-"Starting patrol..."
-"Visiting block: 1,0 (etc)"

Should look like this:

IEnumerator FollowPath()
	{
		print ("Starting patrol...");
		foreach (Waypoint waypoint in path) 
		{
			transform.position = waypoint.transform.position;
			print ("Visting block: " + waypoint);
			yield return new WaitForSeconds (1f);	 
		}
		print("Ending patrol");
	}

Thought Process: 
1.Starting patrol gets printed.
2.Foreach loop gets printed and repeated until end of path is reached.
3.When foreach loop ends Ending patrol will be printed.
